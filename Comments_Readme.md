Java Comments
Comments are text placed within a program to help other users understand the code, 
which the computer ignores when running the program.


There are mainly two kinds of comments:
•	Implementation Comments
•	Documentation Comments


*Implementation Comments
Implementation comments are note-to-self or descriptive comments.

-->Single-Line Comments
//Single Line Comment

-->Multi-Line Comments
/* A multi-line comment
has multiple lines of comments
and helps in adding more description
*/

Clone the repo and try executing the code

Try:
•	Try single-line commenting and uncommenting the lines of code.
•	Understand how the compiler executes the commented line of code.
